# Mirakle
A Gradle plugin that allows you to move build process from a local machine to a remote one.

Compatible with Gradle 3.3+. Works seamlessly with IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio.

#### Why
Remote machine supposed to be much performant than you working machine.
Also having a sufficient network bandwidth or small amount of data that your build produce, you gain **build speed boost**.

#### How it differs from [Mainframer](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer)

Mirakle is designed specially for Gradle build system. It works as seamless as possible. Once plugin installed, you workflow will not be different at all.

(It's a good thing to prank your colleague. Imagine his surprise when one day he get several times faster build time.)


## Setup
* Put this into `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/mirakle_init.gradle`
```groovy
initscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.instamotor:mirakle:1.1.0"
    }
}
 
apply plugin: Mirakle
 
rootProject {
    mirakle {
        host "your_remote_machine"
    }
}
```
* [Setup local machine](docs/SETUP_LOCAL.md)
* [Setup remote machine](docs/SETUP_REMOTE.md)

## Usage
```
> ./gradlew build

Here's Mirakle. All tasks will be executed on a remote machine.
:uploadToRemote
:executeOnRemote
...remote build output...
:downloadFromRemote
 

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
 
Total time : 7.975 secs
Task uploadToRemote took: 2.237 secs
Task executeOnRemote took: 3.706 secs
Task downloadFromRemote took: 1.597 secs
```

To disable remote execution pass `-x mirakle`

```
> ./gradlew build install -x mirakle
```

## Configuration
```groovy
mirakle {
    host "true-remote"
    
    //optional
    remoteFolder ".mirakle"
    excludeLocal += ["foo"]
    excludeRemote += ["bar"]
    excludeCommon += ["**/foobar"]
    rsyncToRemoteArgs += ["--stats", "-h"]
    rsyncFromRemoteArgs += ["--compress-level=5", "--stats", "-h"]
    sshArgs += ["-p 22"]
}
```
### Per-project config
You can configure Mirakle differently for any project. There's two ways:
1. In `USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d/mirakle_init.gradle`
```groovy
initscript { .. }
 
apply plugin: Mirakle
 
rootProject {
    if (name == "My Home Project") {
        mirakle {
            host "my-build-server"
            sshArgs += ["-p 222"]
        }
    } else {
        mirakle {
            host "office-build-server"
        }
    }
}
```
2. In `PROJECT_DIR/mirakle.gradle`. This is useful if you want too add the config to VCS.
```groovy
mirakle {
    host "my-build-server"
    sshArgs += ["-p 222"]
}
```
**Note:** `mirakle.gradle` is the only Gradle build file in the project dir which is evaluated on local machine. Other build files are ignored for the sake of saving time.

##### [Mainframer config](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/blob/development/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) is also supported.
